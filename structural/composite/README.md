Composite is a structural design pattern that can combine single objects or lists of objects of the same kind, group and traverse. 

there are 3 main components:
- leaf - represents leaf objects in the composition with no children (song)
- component - declares the interface for objects in the composition
- composite - stores child components and implements child related operations

some example use cases:
- GUI element
- scehma handling (xml/json)
- page objects
- complicated objects (salesforce, dynamic CRMs)
