Flyweight is a structural design pattern used for minimizing the creation of similar objects that consume a lot of memory and performance,
by sharing common parts of the object state among multiple objects instead of keeping all the data in each object. 

like a library, when a client wants to borrow a book, the library is checking if the book is in the collection, 
if so the client gets it. If not then the library will order (create) a new book and give it to client.
