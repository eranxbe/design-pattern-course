Proxy is a structural design pattern that ,
for example a court house. as a client I can access the court directly with capabilities I own, or access it through a lawyer to act as my proxy, and add additional capabilities.

example use cases:
- access control
- remote object access
- content filtering
- API gateway

in test automation, Healenium does that.

we have an interface that can be implemented by a normal object and a proxy object

and we can use the same functionality from both normal and proxy objects
