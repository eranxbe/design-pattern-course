Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. For example a theme park that each theme has its own food court.
PARK
-->fantasy
---->pizza
---->burger
---->ice cream
-->lego
---->pizza
---->burger
---->ice cream
-->pixar
---->pizza
---->burger
---->ice cream

wheren each food stall relates to its theme area.

Some examples use cases:
- Vehicle manufacturor
- Database abstraction layers
